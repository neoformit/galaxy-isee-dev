# galaxy-isee-dev

Development of iSEE interactive Galaxy tool

This repository is only one half of the iSEE interactive tool - for container development see [isee-docker-galaxy](https://github.com/neoformit/isee-docker-galaxy).

Production releases will be made through PR to Galaxy Core, but these repositories are only used for internal versioning during tool development.
